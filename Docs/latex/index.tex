\hyperlink{class_ab_zip}{Ab\+Zip} is a Qt based C++ class for creating Zip archives. It\textquotesingle{}s not a wrapper for other Zip/\+Unzip code but accesses the archives directly via Q\+I\+O\+Device

Why Qt? Well if you are a C++ programmer and you want to create cross-\/platform applications or utilities, then Qt is simply the best out their! To learn more about Qt goto \href{http://qt-project.org/doc/}{\tt official Qt documentation}

\hyperlink{class_ab_zip}{Ab\+Zip} features include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Creating new or opening existing (Pkware v2.\+0) Zip archives.
\item Add files or entire folders to the archive
\item File name filters can be applied
\item Update existing files
\item Delete files from the archive (not many Zip classes do this as I found out, which is the reason I wrote these classes!)
\item Extract one or more files
\item Extract based on file name filters
\item Search for files, again using wildcard filters
\item Use Strong A\+ES encryption instead of the default Pkware C\+RC base encryption
\item Supports 64bit archives.
\item Additional compression methods can easily be created and added (Currently I\textquotesingle{}ve added B\+Zip2 but intend to start to add others later).

Downloads are available from \href{https://github.com/abelayer/AbZip}{\tt Ab\+Zip project page on Git\+Hub}.\hypertarget{index_platforms}{}\section{Platforms supported}\label{index_platforms}
\hyperlink{class_ab_zip}{Ab\+Zip} has been tested on Windows using win32-\/g++ (Min\+GW)

No testing has been officially done on other systems as yet, but this will change in due course.\hypertarget{index_requirements}{}\section{Requirements and Third-\/party code}\label{index_requirements}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Qt version 4 or 5. See \href{http://www.qt.io/}{\tt Qt Home Page}
\item zlib -\/ This comes as part of Qt 4 and 5.
\item A\+ES -\/ Encryption code by \textquotesingle{}\href{http://http://www.gladman.me.uk/AES}{\tt Brian Gladman}\textquotesingle{}
\item B\+Zip2 -\/ by \textquotesingle{}\href{http://www.bzip.org}{\tt Julian Seward}\textquotesingle{}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_building}{}\section{Building, testing and installing}\label{index_building}
To build the library, run\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ cd /yourprojects/abzip
$ qmake [PREFIX=where-to-install]
$ make
\end{DoxyVerb}


Make sure that you have Qt 4/5 installed with all required headers and utilities. If you need to specify additional include path or libraries, use qmake features (see qmake reference in the Qt documentation).

To install compiled library\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ make install
\end{DoxyVerb}


By default, \hyperlink{class_ab_zip}{Ab\+Zip} compiles as a D\+L\+L/\+SO, but you have other options\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Just copy appropriate source files to your project and use them.
\item Compile it as a static library using C\+O\+N\+F\+IG += staticlib qmake option.
